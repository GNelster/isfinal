            <p><h2>Biography</h2></p>
            <p>
                I grew up in South Jordan, UT and attended Bingham High School. I worked during the latter half of High School in the retail school store of my High School as a shift manager and as a CFO-like position, and then started my Freshman Year at BYU. After completing my Freshman Year, I completed a full-time proselyting mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Charlotte, North Carolina for twenty-four months. Upon returning, I have since resumed my pursuit of an education and obtaining a degree in Information Systems Management from BYU Provo.

            <p>
                I have loved technology for as long as I can remember. I've found it fascinating the entire time, and I've loved seeing new technological advancements being made over the past few years. I'm currently working for BYU-IT in the Religious Education Department as a Computer Support Representative. With that, I help oversee, implement, adjust, troubleshoot, and repair various information technology systems on a daily basis for faculty and staff of the Religious Education Department.

                    <p>I love to play ragtime. Especially "Maple Leaf Rag" or "The Entertainer". Over the years, I've participated in various different competitions and have only received top marks for each performance.
                </p>

            <p><h2>Organ Performance</h2></p>
            <img src="images/organ.jpg." alt="Picture of a Pipe Organ">
                <p>
                    I've been playing the organ for seven years now! With that time, I've been able to play at the following venues:
                <br></p><ul>
                    <li>LDS Churches and Stake Centers across Utah</li>
                    <li>St. George LDS Tabernacle</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>The organ is such a unique and incredibly difficult instrument to learn. Not only do you have to play mutliple keys together like the piano, but you're also playing different notes with your feet, all while trying to stay in time, and following the conductor. It is however, one of the most rewarding instruments to play when you get it correct and into your muscle memory.</p>
                <p>Below is one of the hardest yet most fulfilling pieces to learn and perform on the organ:</p>
